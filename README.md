Fast Food Chain Map: A map of 10,000 randomly selected restaraunts across the USA

The goal of my project was always to show the spread of different chain restaraunts, from more regional ones like SONIC drive in to the widespread golden arches of McDonalds. The restaraunts in the sample with 200+ locations were chosen to be on the legend, while the smaller ones were simply designated as "Other". In the future, I'd like to add a popup onto the dots, so that you can see the names of the places that were too small to list here.

The main function of this application is so that you can filter for the different restaurants and see the spread of different ones across the USA and even further. You can do this through the control panel on the left, which also functions as a legend.
This map was made possible with the help of a Kaggle dataset provided by Datafiniti. I originally was planning to use the whole dataset, instead of the 10,000 point sample, but given the lag already caused by 10,000, I assumed it would be best to not set fire to the end user's computer. I made this with the help of Mapbox, Github, Kaggle, and an old project that sorted video games.
